# eblenix_csgo_public
A hack for counter-strike global offensive, created solely for educational purposes in the process of learning gamehacking, which i sometimes used while playing csgo.
## Note
This cheat was created for educational purposes, do not rely on any VAC protection, the cheat is fully detected, the protection was removed.  
Below is a list of csgo versions on which this cheat works; unfortunately, I don't have time to update it to the latest game version and don't see the point in doing so.  
```
1.37.3.1, 1.37.3.8
```
However, if you want to disable the CSGO version check, you can uncomment the #define line in the ```src/common.h``` file.
```
// Uncomment the following line to disable game version checks
// #define DISABLE_CSGO_VERSION_CHECK
```
## Using
Visual Studio is required for compilation, i am using the 2017 version, compile eblenix_csgo & eblenix_injector and open the injector, then inject it into the game.  
The menu is navigated with the arrow keys, and it can be opened by pressing the ```INSERT``` key.
