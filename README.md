# eblenix_csgo_public
A hack for counter-strike global offensive, created solely for educational purposes in the process of learning gamehacking, which i sometimes used while playing csgo.
## Note
This cheat was created for educational purposes, do not rely on any VAC protection, the cheat is fully detected, the protection was removed.  
Below is a list of csgo versions on which this cheat works; unfortunately, I don't have time to update it to the latest game version and don't see the point in doing so.  
```
1.37.3.1, 1.37.3.8
```
## Using
Visual Studio is required for compilation, i am using the 2017 version, compile eblenix_csgo & eblenix_injector and open the injector, then inject it into the game.  
The menu is navigated with the arrow keys, and it can be opened by pressing the ```INSERT``` key.
#### Important
if you initially launched the injector, then opened csgo and injected, but nothing happens in the main menu of the game, it means that 50 seconds have passed since the injection and your game hasnt loaded the serverbrowser.dll module. just inject again.
### Some info
There are errors in the code; if I have free time, I will try to fix them. Also, the cheat does not have a skin changer because when I used this cheat, I did not need a skin changer, so I considered it unnecessary.
